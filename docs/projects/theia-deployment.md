## Overview

The **theia-deployment** repository is the central hub for the infrastructure-as-code (IaC) of the EduTheia ecosystem. It manages the automated deployment of [Theia Cloud](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia-cloud) to various Kubernetes clusters using GitHub Actions and Helm. This ensures that students and developers have access to a reliable, browser-based IDE environment across production, staging, and testing tiers.

## Key Features

- **Automated CI/CD**: Seamless deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions for various branches and environments.
- **Environment Management**: Specialized configurations for `production`, `staging`, and multiple `test` environments.
- **Custom Helm Charts**:
  - `theia-cloud-combined`: A master chart that bundles all necessary components.
  - `theia-appdefinitions`: Configures the custom IDE environments (images and resources).
  - `theia-certificates`: Manages SSL/TLS certificates, including TUM-specific processes.
  - `theia-monitoring`: Sets up Prometheus and Grafana dashboards for observability.
- **GitOps Workflow**: Deployments are managed through Git with approval gates and automated rollouts to staging.
- **Authentication Integration**: Detailed configuration for Keycloak to manage user access and session security.

## Technical Details

- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes (K8s)
- **Deployment Tooling**: Helm 3.x, GitHub Actions
- **Configuration**: YAML (Helm values)
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **Authentication**: Keycloak
- **Networking**: Ingress-nginx controller, SSL/TLS certificates

## Integration

**theia-deployment** provides the foundation upon which all other EduTheia projects run. It coordinates the deployment of the Theia Cloud base components, the custom IDE blueprints, and the necessary supporting services (like monitoring and authentication). It is directly used to manage the environments that the **theia-scale-tests** project targets.
