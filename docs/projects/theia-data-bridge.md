# Overview

The **Theia Data Bridge** is a VS Code extension designed to facilitate secure data and credential injection into cloud-based IDE sessions. It acts as a communication bridge between the Theia Cloud host and the IDE workspace, allowing runtime configuration without manual user intervention.

## Key Features

- **Data Injection**: Exposes a lean HTTP server within the IDE to receive data (e.g., credentials, environment variables) from the host.
- **VS Code Commands**: Provides commands like `dataBridge.getEnv` for other extensions to retrieve the injected data.
- **In-Memory Storage**: Securely stores injected data in memory for the duration of the session.
- **Centralized Logging**: Includes a robust logging service for easier debugging of the bridge's operation.

## Tech Stack

- **TypeScript**: Implementation language.
- **Hono**: A fast, lightweight web framework for the internal HTTP server.
- **VS Code Extension API**: Integration with the IDE's command and configuration systems.
